<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Americans are anxious about crime regardless of their actual exposure or risk. Given this pervasive concern, US presidents frequently talk about crime, take actions to address it, and list crime prevention efforts among their top accomplishments. We argue that presidents act this way, in part, because fear of crime translates into lowered presidential approval. However, this penalty is not applied evenly. Given the parties' stances toward crime and the criminal justice system, Whites will only punish Democratic presidents (i.e., Clinton and Obama) when they are anxious about crime, while Blacks will only punish Republican presidents (i.e., Bush and Trump). We examine twenty years of survey data and find evidence consistent with our theory. Our results suggest that the relationship between fear of crime and presidential accountability is conditioned by an individual's race and the president's party.

## Under Review

**Benjamin S. Noble**. "Energy Versus Safety: Unilateral Action, Voter Welfare, and Executive Accountability." *(Revise and Resubmit)*.

<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Does increasing executive power necessarily decrease accountability? To answer this question, I develop a two-period signaling model comparing voter welfare in two separation-of-powers settings. In one, the executive works with a median legislator to change policy; in the other, the executive chooses between legislation or unilateral action. Both politicians may have preferences that diverge from the voter's, yet I find that increasing executive power may increase accountability and welfare, even in some cases when the legislator is more likely to share the voter's preferences. Unilateral power allows a congruent executive to overcome gridlock, implement the voter's preferred policy, and reveal information about the politicians' typesâ€”which can outweigh the risks of a divergent executive wielding power for partisan ends.

**Benjamin S. Noble** and Taylor N. Carlson. "All the Right Enemies: Elite Conspiracy Endorsement and the Lamestream Media Heuristic."

<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Why do politicians endorse conspiracy theories? Where existing research has focused on conspiracy theory belief among the mass public, it has rarely considered strategic motives of elites. We argue that politicians endorse conspiracy theories to signal ideological and anti-establishment credentials, generating negative press coverage which they can deploy as further evidence of institutional bias. To test our theory, we focus on QAnon, a much-discussed 2020 conspiracy theory. Observationally, we find that congressional candidates who endorsed QAnon garnrered a higher share of negative media coverage than a matched set of non-endorsing counterparts. Experimentally, we test X pre-registered hypotheses which recieve mixed support. We find that candidates who endorse QAnon and recieve negative news coverage pay a smaller penalty among those with low trust in media, but respondents never increase their support for a conspiracy-minded candidate. While these findings suggest candidates can weaponize political mistrust to blunt some criticism, this strategy is less effective than conventional wisdom might suggest.

## Working Papers

**Benjamin S. Noble**. "Quiet Proponents, Loud Opponents: Congressional Rhetoric, the President, and Negative Partisanship."  
<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Why do members of Congress talk about the president, and when are they more likely to do so? I argue that legislators invoke the president strategically to expand the scope of conflict and take advantage of negative partisanship, increasing their own support among co-partisan constituents. I hypothesize that lawmakers in the presidential out-party, and especially those who represent homogeneous constituencies comprised of presidential out-partisans, will be more likely to engage in this behavior, leading to a pattern of asymmetric presidentialization. To support my  theory, I present evidence of these patterns in 1.5 million floor speeches given by 1,900 lawmakers between 1981-2016. I also provide behavioral evidence of the polarizing power of presidentialized rhetoric with data from a pilot experiment. I suggest that much of what we think of as nationalization may be better understood as a preoccupation with presidential politics at the mass and elite levels.

## Other Selected Work

Zoe Ang, **Benjamin S. Noble**, and Andrew Reeves. "Public Opinion and Public Support in Crisis Management." *Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics*, 2021.

<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

In times of crisis, citizens look to their leaders for aid and assistance. In the democratic context, the focal figure is likely the chief executive, accountable to the whole of the nation. Focusing specifically on the American president and the incidences of natural hazards, we analyze public opinion and governmental response to these crises. While one might expect such a universal actor to aid each according to their need, new scholarship concerning voter behavior and electoral incentives has found that the president is incentivized to support only a small slice of the electorate. Empowered by federal disaster relief legislation in the 1950s, the president targets electorally profitable voters when disbursing aid or allocating resources to control disaster damage. Voters in those areas respond myopically and tend to vote for the incumbent, whether because they have been economically or emotionally supported. Thus, elites anticipate voter reactions and strategically respond to disasters to mitigate blame or punishment for the event and capitalize on an opportunity for electoral gains.
