  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Americans are anxious about crime regardless of their actual exposure or risk. Given this pervasive concern, US presidents frequently talk about crime, take actions to address it, and list crime prevention efforts among their top accomplishments. We argue that presidents act this way, in part, because fear of crime translates into lowered presidential approval. However, this penalty is not applied evenly. Given the parties' stances toward crime and the criminal justice system, White Americans punish Democratic presidents (i.e., Clinton and Obama) more severely when they are anxious about crime, while Black Americans are more punitive toward Republican presidents (i.e., Bush and Trump). We examine twenty years of survey data and find evidence consistent with our theory. Our results suggest that the relationship between fear of crime and presidential accountability is conditioned by an individual’s race and the president’s party.

  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Does increasing executive power necessarily decrease accountability? To answer this question, I develop a two-period signaling model comparing voter welfare in two separation-of-powers settings. In one, the executive works with a median legislator to change policy; in the other, the executive chooses between legislation or unilateral action. Both politicians may have preferences that diverge from the voter's, yet I find that increasing executive power may increase accountability and welfare, even in some cases when the legislator is more likely to share the voter's preferences. Unilateral power allows a congruent executive to overcome gridlock, implement the voter's preferred policy, and reveal information about the politicians' types—which can outweigh the risks of a divergent executive wielding power for partisan ends.

**Benjamin S. Noble** and Taylor N. Carlson. "CueAnon: The (not so) Strategic Endorsement of Political Conspiracy Theories."

<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Why do politicians endorse conspiracy theories? Where existing research has focused on conspiracy theory belief among the mass public, there is little research into the costs and benefits to candidates who support them. We test two theories: that candidate conspiracy endorsement could provoke negative media coverage and support among voters with low trust in media or that such behavior is counterproductive to candidates’ electoral prospects. Our observational and experimental studies, which focus on candidate support for QAnon, find no positive effects of endorsement. This holds for several subpopulations of interest such as Republicans, conservatives, those with low trust in media, and those with anti-establishment beliefs. Ultimately, we find that if voters support candidates who endorse QAnon, they do so despite the endorsement. Our research complicates popular narratives about conspiracy theories and candidate choice and indicates the importance of causally testing theories about public support for conspiracy theories.

**Benjamin S. Noble**. "Quiet Proponents, Loud Opponents: Congressional Rhetoric, the President, and Negative Partisanship."  
<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Why do members of Congress talk about the president, and when are they more likely to do so? I argue that legislators invoke the president strategically to expand the scope of conflict and take advantage of negative partisanship, increasing their own support among co-partisan constituents. I hypothesize that lawmakers in the presidential out-party, and especially those who represent homogeneous constituencies comprised of presidential out-partisans, will be more likely to engage in this behavior, leading to a pattern of asymmetric presidentialization. To support my  theory, I present evidence of these patterns in 1.5 million floor speeches given by 1,900 lawmakers between 1981-2016. I also provide behavioral evidence of the polarizing power of presidentialized rhetoric with data from a pilot experiment. I suggest that much of what we think of as nationalization may be better understood as a preoccupation with presidential politics at the mass and elite levels.

  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

In times of crisis, citizens look to their leaders for aid and assistance. In the democratic context, the focal figure is likely the chief executive, accountable to the whole of the nation. Focusing specifically on the American president and the incidences of natural hazards, we analyze public opinion and governmental response to these crises. While one might expect such a universal actor to aid each according to their need, new scholarship concerning voter behavior and electoral incentives has found that the president is incentivized to support only a small slice of the electorate. Empowered by federal disaster relief legislation in the 1950s, the president targets electorally profitable voters when disbursing aid or allocating resources to control disaster damage. Voters in those areas respond myopically and tend to vote for the incumbent, whether because they have been economically or emotionally supported. Thus, elites anticipate voter reactions and strategically respond to disasters to mitigate blame or punishment for the event and capitalize on an opportunity for electoral gains.
