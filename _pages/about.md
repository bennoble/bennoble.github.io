I study American political institutions, specifically the presidency, Congress, and the separation of powers. My research leverages text-as-data methods and formal modeling to investigate the strategic use of executive and congressional rhetoric and its effects on public opinion and voter behavior. 

My APSA 2022 paper argues that while persuasion is often posited as the president's primary rhetorical goal, little research has considered whether presidents are strategic about *when* they attempt to persuade the public. In particular, I theorize that the power to persuade is variable and dependent on political conditions; as such, strategic presidents turn toward a different rhetorical strategy—mobilizing existing supporters—when they anticipate a lower likelihood of persuasion (i.e., divided government, polarization) or when persuasion is unnecessary (i.e., high approval). To support this theory, I assemble a corpus of 18,000 presidential speeches and use semi-supervised machine learning and word-embedding techniques to develop a novel measure of the relative persuasiveness of over 200,000 spoken paragraphs given by presidents Reagan through Biden. I find that presidents have long used a mix of persuasive and mobilizing appeals that predictably vary with political and institutional conditions. This theory contributes to our understanding of the rhetorical presidency, going public, and political persuasion more broadly while my measure can be applied to the study of other elite actors and institutional contexts.

Some of my other projects focus on [presidential approval in the context of race-based anxiety about crime](https://academic.oup.com/poq/advance-article/doi/10.1093/poq/nfab074/6530176?guestAccessKey=fbab726b-6f74-4bc6-ae40-3f4625a25add), the [president as a polarizing symbol in congressional rhetoric](/files/papers/noble_presidentialcue.pdf), and [unilateral action as a signal of presidential type](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/energy-versus-safety-unilateral-action-voter-welfare-and-executive-accountability/83154F276FCBB0FC7745284A36CE4FA4). My work has recently appeared in *Political Science Research and Methods* and *Public Opinion Quarterly*.
