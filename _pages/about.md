I study American political institutions with an emphasis on the ways in which audience costs shape interactions between the legislative and executive branches. My research leverages formal models and text-as-data methods to understand how the president—as a political actor and partisan symbol—shapes the ways in which members of Congress represent their constituents. 

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. You can get in touch with me at [bsnoble@wustl.edu](mailto:bsnoble@wustl.edu).
