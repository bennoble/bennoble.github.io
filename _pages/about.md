I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis and will be on the job market in Fall 2023. You can get in touch with me at [bsnoble@wustl.edu](mailto:bsnoble@wustl.edu).

My research in American institutions focuses on the U.S. presidency and executive-legislative separation of powers using text-as-data methods. I complement this methodological approach with formal theoretic models and survey experiments. My work contributes to our understanding of presidential agenda-setting, going public, and how interbranch conflict shapes what politicians say and how they say it. My research highlights the institutional consequences of nationalization, polarization, and negative partisanship.

In my three-paper dissertation, I develop a new theory of how presidents "go public" in an era of nationalization and polarization. The first paper, "[How Presidents Persuade: Facts, Feelings, and the Language of Presidential Power](/files/papers/noble_how_presidents_persuade.pdf)," argues that presidents change minds with factual appeals and mobilize supporters with emotional speech. The second paper of my dissertation, "[Presidential Cues and the Nationalization of Congressional Rhetoric, 1973-2016](/files/papers/noble_presidentialcues.pdf)" (conditionally accepted, *AJPS*), investigates how lawmakers respond to presidential leadership. I argue that members of Congress, especially out-partisans, invoke the president in speeches to nationalize legislative debate and polarize constituents. In the third paper, "[Energy versus Safety: Unilateral Action, Voter Welfare, and Executive Accountability](https://www-cambridge-org.libproxy.wustl.edu/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/energy-versus-safety-unilateral-action-voter-welfare-and-executive-accountability/83154F276FCBB0FC7745284A36CE4FA4)" (*PSRM*, 2021), I develop a formal model investigating how executive-legislative conflict and unilateral action signals information to voters about politiciansâ€™ preferences.

I also maintain an active, collaborative research agenda on executive politics, interbranch conflict, and public attitudes toward the presidency and Congress. One of these articles, "[Crime and Presidential Accountability: A Case of Racially Conditioned Issue Ownership](https://academic.oup.com/poq/advance-article/doi/10.1093/poq/nfab074/6530176?guestAccessKey=fbab726b-6f74-4bc6-ae40-3f4625a25add)" (with Steven Webster and Andrew Reeves, was published in *POQ* in 2022. I am also an associate researcher with the Governor Speech Project (lead by Dan Butler and Joe Sutherland), a comprehensive source of gubernatorial documents.

Outside of academia, I perform improvisational comedy, play a lot of board games, and volunteer with Boys Hope Girls Hope, a non-profit that provides educational, mentoring, and professional-development programming for academically motivated, but disadvantaged and underrepresented, students.
