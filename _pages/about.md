I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at University of California, San Diego.

My research examines American political institutions through the lens of strategic partisan communication, focusing on how executives and legislators increasingly weaponize partisan rhetoric to rally their own supporters and attack the opposition. Using text-as-data methods applied to millions of speeches, alongside formal theoretic models and survey experiments, my research shows that modern political conflict isn't an unfortunate byproduct of ideological differencesâ€”it's deliberately manufactured by strategic elites who find it electorally profitable to perform opposition rather than govern. I show that the system of checks and balances has transformed from a safeguard against government overreach into a weapon for partisan mobilization---with systematic consequences for cross-party cooperation, voter behavior, and democratic accountability. By focusing on the rhetorical dimensions of modern American political conflict, this work contributes to our understanding of nationalization, negative partisanship, and the feedback effects between elite rhetoric and mass polarization.
