I study American political institutions, specifically the presidency, Congress, and the separation of powers. My research leverages formal modeling and text-as-data methods to understand strategic interactions between the president, Congress, and the public. My dissertation focuses on presidential agenda-setting and congressional response. 

<!-- My published research has appeared in *Political Science Research and Methods* and *Public Opinion Quarterly.* -->

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. You can get in touch with me at [bsnoble@wustl.edu](mailto:bsnoble@wustl.edu).
