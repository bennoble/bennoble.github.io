I study American political institutions, specifically the presidency, Congress, and the separation of powers. My dissertation investigates how presidents persuade with facts and mobilize with feelings using text-as-data and experimental methods. Some of my other projects focus on [presidential approval in the context of race-based anxiety about crime](https://academic.oup.com/poq/advance-article/doi/10.1093/poq/nfab074/6530176?guestAccessKey=fbab726b-6f74-4bc6-ae40-3f4625a25add), presidential cues and the nationalization of congressional rhetoric, and a formal model of [unilateral action as a signal of presidential type](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/energy-versus-safety-unilateral-action-voter-welfare-and-executive-accountability/83154F276FCBB0FC7745284A36CE4FA4). My work has recently appeared in *Political Science Research and Methods* and *Public Opinion Quarterly*. I recently [won the Dean's Award for Graduate Research Excellence](https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand/graduate-students-recognized-research-excellence), a university-wide award recognizing outstanding achievement in graduate research.

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis and will be on the job market in Fall 2023. You can get in touch with me at [bsnoble@wustl.edu](mailto:bsnoble@wustl.edu).
