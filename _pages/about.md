I study American political institutions with an emphasis on inter-institutional dynamics between the legislative and executive branches. My research leverages formal models and text analysis to understand how elected officials balance constituent and partisan priorities. 

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. You can get in touch with me at [bsnoble@wustl.edu](mailto:bsnoble@wustl.edu)
