I study how presidents and members of Congress deliberately manufacture political conflict through partisan rhetoric, transforming institutional checks and balances into tools of partisan mobilization.

My research blends text analysis with institutional theory to understand how elite messaging reshapes democratic accountability. I also teach American politics, quantitative methods, and AI.
