Introduction about using texshop

Sublime Text 3 (hereafter, Sublime) is a very attractive text editor that makes writing LaTeX a breeze. A few features that I really like.

## How to Set Up Sublime Text 3 for LaTeX

### If you have never used Sublime, start here

1. If you haven't already, [download Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and install it on your computer. It is technically a paid app, but there is a un-timed and unlimited free trial.

2. Open Sublime and hit <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Mac (<kbd>CRTL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Windows). This opens the Command Palette. Type `Install Package Control`, and press `enter`. 

3. After package control is installed, type <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> again to access package control and type "install package" and press `enter`. When the new window appears type "Latex Tools" and press `enter`. This will install Latex on Sublime.
